                    <h2>About Our Online Multiplayer Trivia Game</h2>

                    <p>Welcome to our online multiplayer trivia game! We provide an exciting platform where players from around the world can challenge their knowledge and compete against each other in various trivia categories. Our game utilizes the renowned Elo rating system to rank and rate our registered players.</p>

                    <h3>How does the Elo rating system work?</h3>
                    <p>The Elo rating system is a widely recognized method for calculating the relative skill levels of players in competitive games. In our trivia game, every player starts with an initial rating of 1500 points. This rating serves as a baseline that reflects their starting skill level. As players participate in trivia matches and tournaments, their ratings will dynamically adjust based on their performance.</p>

                    <h3>Climbing the ranks:</h3>
                    <p>When a player achieves a high rank in a trivia match, their rating will increase, reflecting their success and improved skill level. The amount by which their rating increases is determined by several factors, including the ratings of their opponents and the expected outcome of the match based on those ratings. By consistently performing well and defeating strong opponents, players have the opportunity to climb the ranks and solidify their position among the top players.</p>

                    <h3>Facing challenges:</h3>
                    <p>However, in our trivia game, winning is not the only path to improvement. Even if a player doesn't secure a victory in a match, their rating may still be positively impacted by performing better than expected based on their opponent's rating. This recognizes the effort and skill demonstrated by players who put up a strong fight, even in defeat.</p>

                    <h3>Strive for excellence:</h3>
                    <p>Our online multiplayer trivia game is designed to encourage healthy competition, intellectual growth, and continuous improvement. We believe that every player has the potential to reach new heights and surpass their own expectations. By engaging in challenging trivia battles, players can sharpen their knowledge, expand their horizons, and refine their strategic thinking abilities.</p>
